This is a K-Mean clustring experiment

Data set is from UC Irvine: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

This program completes three function:
1. Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to subdivide these points into three
clusters
2. Identify the clustering centers (centroids)
3. Draw a 2-D Euclidean space diagram to show the final partition results on
the input dataset.
